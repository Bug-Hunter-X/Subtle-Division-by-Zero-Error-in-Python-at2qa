# Subtle Division by Zero Error in Python

This repository demonstrates a subtle division by zero error in Python that might not be immediately apparent.

The `bug.py` file contains a function that attempts to handle division by zero. However, the function contains a logic error that allows a division by zero to occur despite the checks in place.

The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to modify the code to fix the error. The solution involves rearranging the conditionals to ensure the check for zero is performed correctly.
